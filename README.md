Monte Carlo Simulation of the Ising Model

Using Monte Carlo Simulation to represent Ising's Model for ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials. Considering the spin of the neighboring electrons, and the model's equation (in 2 dimantions), we can simulate the behavior of the materials. To do this, we use Metropolis Algorithm and the Monte Carlo Step.
